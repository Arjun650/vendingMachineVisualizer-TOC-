Vending Machine Visualizer - Theory of Computation
=======


This project is a DFA (Deterministic Finite Automaton) visualizer tailored specifically for modeling the functionality of a vending machine. DFA is a mathematical model used to represent finite states and transitions between those states in a system.

In this context, the vending machine is represented as a DFA, where each state represents a different stage in the vending process (e.g., idle, selecting item, dispensing, etc.), and transitions between states are triggered by user input (e.g., inserting coins, selecting an item).

The purpose of this visualizer is to provide a clear and intuitive representation of how a vending machine operates, allowing users to understand its functionality through visualizations of states and transitions.

Tech Stack
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
Visualization: D3.js (or similar, if applicable)
Backend (if applicable): Node.js
Deployment: Vercel
How to Use
Visit the Live Demo: Check out the project live at Vercel (insert your Vercel deployment link).
Select a Product: Choose from a list of available products.
Insert Coins: Simulate inserting coins by interacting with the machine.
Watch the State Changes: The visualizer will show how the machine changes states as it processes your inputs.
